This is where we will make notes of things that we have TO DO.

Together:

RMI Distribution and conversion from RMI to TCP.

Matt:

Investigate use of lambda functions for serialization, whatever that means.

Oliver:

Investigate implementation of TCP communication and understand "the Middleware must not block when it is waiting for the ResourceManagers to execute a request..."
